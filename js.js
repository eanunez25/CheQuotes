  `"If you don't know what cinco de mayo is, it's a celebration of Mexico's 1862 victory in battle over France, although France, who previously had not won a war since 1066, later won the war against Mexico. However, since the Mexicans beat the French for this one battle, Mexicans took their cue from the Irish (who don't actually celebrate St. Patrick's Day, from what I can tell). The Mexicans said, "Okay, hey, let's do a pub crawl!!!!!' Except they said it in Spanish. Which makes me wonder why Mexicans would do a pub crawl, seeing as how Mexico doesn't seem to have a lot of pubs, seeing as how it's Mexico and not Ireland. But never mind that now. You should also never mind the fact that cinco de mayo is more widely celebrated here in the States than it is in Mexico." -Urban Dictionary`,

  `"The shopping cart is the ultimate litmus test for whether a person is capable of self-governing. <br><br>
  To return the shopping cart is an easy, convenient task and one which we all recognize as the correct, appropriate thing to do. To return the shopping cart is objectively right. There are no situations other than dire emergencies in which a person is not able to return their cart. Simultaneously, it is not illegal to abandon your shopping cart. Therefore the shopping cart presents itself as the apex example of whether a person will do what is right without being forced to do it. No one will punish you for not returning the shopping cart, no one will fine you or kill you for not returning the shopping cart, you gain nothing by returning the shopping cart. You must return the shopping cart out of the goodness of your own heart. You must return the shopping cart because it is the right thing to do. Because it is correct. <br><br>
  A person who is unable to do this is no better than an animal, an absolute savage who can only be made to do what is right by threatening them with a law and the force that stands behind it. <br><br>
  The Shopping Cart is what determines whether a person is a good or bad member of society."`,

  Evening Star<br><br>
  There was, as in the fairy tales,<br>
  As ne'er in the time's raid,<br>
  There was, of famous royal blood<br>
  A most beautiful maid.<br><br>
  
  She was her parents' only child,<br>
  Bright like the sun at noon,<br>
  Like the Virgin midst the saints<br>
  And among stars the moon.<br><br>
  
  From the deep shadow of the vaults<br>
  Her step now she directs<br>
  Toward a window; at its nook<br>
  Bright Evening-star expects.<br><br>
  
  She looks as in the distant seas<br>
  He rises, darts his rays<br>
  And leads the blackish, loaded ships<br>
  On the wet, moving, ways.<br><br>
  
  To look at him every night<br>
  Her soul her instincts spur;<br>
  And as he looks at her for weeks<br>
  He falls in love with her.<br><br>
  
  And as on her elbows she leans<br>
  Her temple and her whim<br>
  She feels in her heart and soul that<br>
  She falls in love with him.<br><br>
  
  And ev'ry night his stormy flames<br>
  More stormily renew<br>
  When in the shadow of the castle<br>
  She shows to his bright view.<br><br>
  
  And to her room with her slow steps<br>
  He bears his steps and aims<br>
  Weaving out of his sparkles cold<br>
  A toil of shaking flames.<br><br>
  
  And when she throws upon her bed<br>
  Her tired limbs and reposes,<br>
  He glides his light along her hands<br>
  And her sweet eyelash closes.<br><br>
  
  And from the mirror on her shape<br>
  A beam has spread and burns,<br>
  On her big eyes that beat though closed<br>
  And on her face that turns.<br><br>
  
  Her smiles view him; the mirror shows<br>
  Him trembling in the nook<br>
  For he is plunging in her dream<br>
  So that their souls may hook.<br><br>
  
  She speaks with him in sleep and sighs<br>
  While her heart's swelled veins drum:<br>
  -"O sweet Lord of my fairy nights,<br>
  Why comest thou not? Come!<br><br>
  
  Descend to me, mild Evening-star<br>
  Thou canst glide on a beam,<br>
  Enter my dwelling and my mind<br>
  And over my life gleam!"<br><br>
  
  And he listens and trembles and<br>
  Still more for her love craves<br>
  And as quick as the lightning he<br>
  Plunges into the waves.<br><br>
  
  The water in that very spot<br>
  Moves rolling many rings<br>
  And out of the unknown, dark, depth<br>
  A superb young man springs.<br><br>
  
  As on a threshold o'er the sill<br>
  His hasty steps he leads,<br>
  Holds in his hand a staff with, at<br>
  Its top, a crown of reeds!<br><br>
  
  A young Voivode he seems to be<br>
  With soft and golden hair;<br>
  A blue shroud binds in a knot on<br>
  His naked shoulder fair.<br><br>
  
  The shade of his face is of wax<br>
  And thou canst see throughout -<br>
  A handsome dead man with live eyes<br>
  That throw their sparkles out.<br><br>
  
  -"From my sphere hardly I come to<br>
  Follow thy call and thee,<br>
  The heaven is my father and<br>
  My mother is the sea.<br><br>
  
  So that I could come to thy room<br>
  And look at thee from near<br>
  With my light reborn from waves my<br>
  Fate toward thee I steer.<br><br>
  
  O come, my treasure wonderful<br>
  And thy world leave aside;<br>
  For I am Evening-star up from<br>
  And thou wouldst be my bride.<br><br>
  
  In my palace of coral I'll<br>
  Take thee for evermore<br>
  And the entire world of the sea<br>
  Will kneel before thy door."<br><br>
  
  -"O thou art beautiful as but<br>
  In dreams an angel shows,<br>
  The way though thou hast oped for me<br>
  For me's for ever close.<br><br>
  
  Thy port and mien and speech are strange<br>
  Life thy gleams don't impart,<br>
  For I'm alive and thou art dead<br>
  And thy eyes chill my heart."<br><br>
  
  Days have past since: but Evening-star<br>
  Comes up againd and stays<br>
  Just as before, spreading o'er her<br>
  His clear, translucent rays.<br><br>
  
  In sleep she would remember him<br>
  And, as before, her whole<br>
  Wish for the Master of the waves<br>
  Is clinching now her soul.<br><br>
  
  -"Descend to me, mild Evening-star<br>
  Thou canst glide on a beam,<br>
  Enter my dwelling and my mind<br>
  And over my life gleam!"<br><br>
  
  He hears: and from the dire despair<br>
  Of such an woeful weird<br>
  He dies, and the heavens revolve<br>
  Where he has disappeared.<br><br>
  
  Soon in the air flames ruddy spread,<br>
  The world in their grip hold;<br>
  A superb form the spasms of the<br>
  Chaotic valleys mold.<br><br>
  
  On his locks of black hair he bears<br>
  His crown a fierce fire frames;<br>
  He floats as he really comes<br>
  Swimming in the sun's flames.<br><br>
  
  His black shroud lets develop out<br>
  His arms marbly and hale;<br>
  He pensively and sadly brings<br>
  His face awfully pale.<br><br>
  
  But his big wonderful eyes' gleam,<br>
  Chimerically deep,<br>
  Shows two unsatiated spasms<br>
  That but into dark peep.<br><br>
  
  -"From my sphere hardly I come to<br>
  Follow thy voice, thy sight;<br>
  The bright sun is my father and<br>
  My mother is the night.<br><br>
  
  O come, my treasure wonderful<br>
  And thy world leave aside<br>
  For I am Evening-star from up<br>
  And thou wouldst be my bride.<br><br>
  
  O come, and upon thy blond hair<br>
  Crowns of stars I shall crowd,<br>
  And more that all of them, up there,<br>
  Thou wild look fair and proud."<br><br>
  
  -"O thou art beautiful as but<br>
  In dreams a demon shows,<br>
  The way though hast oped for me<br>
  For me's for ever close.<br><br>
  
  The depths of my breast ache from the<br>
  Desire of thy fierce love<br>
  My heavy, big eyes also ache<br>
  When into them thine shove".<br><br>
  
  -"But how wouldst thou that I come down?<br>
  Know this - for, do I lie? -:<br>
  I am immortal, while thou art<br>
  One of those that must die!"<br><br>
  
  -"I hate big words, nor do I know<br>
  How to begin my plea;<br>
  And although thy discourse is clear<br>
  I don't understand thee.<br><br>
  
  But if thou wantest my flamed love<br>
  And that would not be sham,<br>
  Come down on this temporal earth,<br>
  Be mortal as I am!"<br><br>
  
  -"I'd lose my immortality<br>
  For but one kiss of thine!<br>
  Well, I will show thee how much too<br>
  For thy fierce love I pine!<br><br>
  
  Yes, I shall be reborn from sin,<br>
  Receive another creed:<br>
  From that endlessness to which I<br>
  Am tied, I shall be freed!"<br><br>
  
  And out he went, he went, went out,<br>
  Loving a human fay,<br>
  He plucked himself off from the sky,<br>
  Went for many a day.<br><br>
  
  
  Meanwhile, the house-boy, Catalin,<br>
  Sly, and who often jests<br>
  When he's filling with wine the cups<br>
  Of the banqueting guests;<br><br>
  
  A page that carries step by step<br>
  The trail of the Queen's gown,<br>
  A wandering bastard, but bold<br>
  Like no one in the town;<br><br>
  
  His little cheek - a peony<br>
  That under the sun stews;<br>
  Watchful, just like a thief, he sneaks<br>
  In Catalina's views.<br><br>
  
  -"How beautiful she grew" - thinks he -<br>
  "A flower just to pluck!<br>
  Now, Catalin, but now it is<br>
  Thy chance to try thy luck!"<br><br>
  
  And by the way, hurriedly, he<br>
  Corners that human fay:<br>
  -"What's with thee, Catalin? Let me<br>
  Alone and go thy way!"<br><br>
  
  -"No! I want thee to stay away<br>
  From thoughts that have no fun<br>
  . I want to see thee only laugh,<br>
  Give me a kiss, just one!"<br><br>
  
  -"I don't know what it is about<br>
  And, believe me, retire!<br>
  But for one Evening-star up from<br>
  I've kept my strong desire!"<br><br>
  
  -"If thou dost not know I could show<br>
  Thee all about love's balm!<br>
  Only, don't give way to thy ire<br>
  And listen and be calm.<br><br>
  
  So as the hunter throws the net<br>
  That many birds would harm,<br>
  When I'll stretch my left arm to thee,<br>
  Enlace me with thy arm.<br><br>
  
  Under my eyes keep thine and don't<br>
  Let them move on their wheels<br>
  And if I lift thee by the waist<br>
  Thou must lift on thy heels.<br><br>
  
  When I bend down my face, to hold<br>
  Thine up must be thy strife;<br>
  So, to each other we could throw<br>
  Sweet, eager, looks for life.<br><br>
  
  And so that thou have about love<br>
  A knowledge true and plain,<br>
  When I stoop to kiss thee, thou must<br>
  Kiss me too and again."<br><br>
  
  With much bewilderment her mind<br>
  The little boy's word fills,<br>
  And shyly and nicely now she<br>
  Wills not, and now she wills.<br><br>
  
  And slowly she tells him:- "Since thy<br>
  Childhood I've known thy wit,<br>
  And as thou art and glib and small<br>
  My temper thou wouldst fit.<br><br>
  
  But Evening-star sprung from the calm<br>
  Of the oblivion,<br>
  Though, gives horizon limitless<br>
  To the sea lone and dun.<br><br>
  
  And secretly, I close my eyes<br>
  For my eyelash tears dim<br>
  When the waves of the sea go on<br>
  Travelling toward him.<br><br>
  
  He shines with love unspeakable<br>
  So that my pains he'd leach,<br>
  But higher and higher soars, so<br>
  That his hand I'd ne'er reach.<br><br>
  
  Sadly thrusts from the worlds which from<br>
  My soul his cold ray bar...<br>
  I shall love him for ever and<br>
  For ever he'll rove far.<br><br>
  
  Like the unmeasured steppes my days<br>
  Are deaf and wild, therefore,<br>
  But my nights spread a holy charm<br>
  I understand no more!"<br><br>
  
  -"Thou art a child! Let's go! Through new<br>
  Lands our own fate let's frame!<br>
  Soon they shall have lost our trace and<br>
  Forgot even our name!<br><br>
  
  We shall be both wise, glad and whole<br>
  As my judgement infers<br>
  And thou wouldst not long for thy kin<br>
  Nor yearn for Evening-stars!"<br><br>
  
  
  Then Evening-star went out. His wings<br>
  Grow, into heavens dash,<br>
  And on his way millenniums<br>
  Flee in less than a flash.<br><br>
  
  Below, a depth of stars; above,<br>
  The heaven stars begem, -<br>
  He seems an endless lightning that<br>
  Is wandering through them.<br><br>
  
  And from the Chaos' vales he sees<br>
  How in an immense ring<br>
  Round him, as in the World's first day,<br>
  Lights from their sources spring;<br><br>
  
  How, springing, they hem him like an<br>
  Ocean that swimming nears...<br>
  He flees carried by his desire<br>
  Until he disappears.<br><br>
  
  For that region is boundless and<br>
  Searching regards avoids<br>
  And Time strive vainly there to come<br>
  To life from the dark voids.<br><br>
  
  'Tis nought. 'Tis, though, thirst that sips him<br>
  And which he cannot shun,<br>
  'Tis depth unknown, comparable<br>
  To blind oblivion.<br><br>
  
  -"From that dark, choking, endlessness<br>
  Into which I am furled,<br>
  Father, undo me, and for e'er<br>
  Be praised in the whole world!<br><br>
  
  Ask anything for this new fate<br>
  For with mine I am through:<br>
  O hear my prayer, O my Lord, for<br>
  Thou gives life and death too.<br><br>
  
  Take back my endlessness, the fires<br>
  That my being devour<br>
  And in return give me a chance<br>
  To love but for an hour!<br><br>
  
  I've come from Chaos; I'd return<br>
  To that my former nest...<br>
  And as I have been brought to life<br>
  From rest, I crave for rest!"<br><br>
  
  -"Hyperion, that comest from<br>
  The depths with the world's swarm,<br>
  Do not ask signs and miracles<br>
  That have no name nor form.<br><br>
  
  Thou wantest to count among men,<br>
  Take their resemblance vain;<br>
  But would now the whole mankind die<br>
  Men will be born again.<br><br>
  
  But they are building on the wind<br>
  Ideals void and blind;<br>
  When human waves run into graves<br>
  New waves spring from behind.<br><br>
  
  Fate's persecutions, lucky stars,<br>
  They only are to own;<br>
  Here we know neither time nor space,<br>
  Death we have never known.<br><br>
  
  From the eternal yesterday<br>
  Drinks what to-day will drain<br>
  And if a sun dies on the sky<br>
  A sun quickens again.<br><br>
  
  Risen as for ever, death though<br>
  Follows them like a thorn<br>
  For all are born only to die<br>
  And die to be reborn.<br><br>
  
  But thou remainest wheresoe'er<br>
  Thou wouldst set down or flee.<br>
  Thou art of the prime form and an<br>
  Eternal prodigy.<br><br>
  
  Thou wilt now hear the wondrous voice<br>
  At whose bewitched singing<br>
  Mounts woody get skipping to skies<br>
  Into sea Island sinking!<br><br>
  
  Perhaps thou wilt more: show in deeds<br>
  Thy sense of justice, might,<br>
  Out of the earth's lumps make an empire<br>
  And settle on its height!<br><br>
  
  I can give thee millions of vessels<br>
  And hosts; thou, bear thy breath<br>
  O'er all the lands, o'er all the oceans:<br>
  I cannot give thee death.<br><br>
  
  For whom thou wantest then to die?<br>
  Just go and see what's worth<br>
  All that is waiting there for thee<br>
  On that wandering earth!"<br><br>
  
  
  His first dominion on the sky<br>
  Hyperion restores<br>
  And like in his first day, his light<br>
  All o'er again he pours.<br><br>
  
  For it is evening and the night<br>
  Her duty never waives.<br>
  Now the moon rises quietly<br>
  And shaking from the waves,<br><br>
  
  And upon the paths of the groves<br>
  Her sparkles again drone...<br>
  Under the row of linden-trees<br>
  Two youths sit all alone.<br><br>
  
  -"O darling, let my blessed ear feel<br>
  How thy heart's pulses beat,<br>
  Under the ray of thy eyes clear<br>
  And unspeakably sweet.<br><br>
  
  With the charms of their cold light pierce<br>
  My thought's faery glades,<br>
  Pour an eternal quietness<br>
  On my passion's dark shades.<br><br>
  
  And there, above, remain to stop<br>
  Thy woe's violet stream,<br>
  For thou art my first source of love<br>
  And also my last dream!"<br><br>
  
  Hyperion beholds how love<br>
  Their eyes equally charms:<br>
  Scarcely his arm touches her neck,<br>
  She takes him in her arms.<br><br>
  
  The silvery blooms spread their smells<br>
  And their soft cascade strokes<br>
  The tops of the heads of both youths<br>
  With long and golden locks.<br><br>
  
  And all bewitched by love, she lifts<br>
  Her eyes toward the fires<br>
  Of the witnessing Evening-star<br>
  And trusts him her desires:<br><br>
  
  -"Descend to me, mild Evening-star<br>
  Thou canst glide on a beam,<br>
  Enter my forest and my mind<br>
  And o'er my good luck gleam!"<br><br>
  
  As he did it once, into woods,<br>
  On hills, his rays he urges,<br>
  Guiding throughout so many wilds<br>
  The gleaming, moving, surges.<br><br>
  
  But he falls not as he did once<br>
  From his height into swells:<br>
  -"What matters thee, clod of dust, if<br>
  'Tis me or some one else?<br><br>
  
  You live in your sphere's narrowness<br>
  And luck rules over you -<br>
  But in my steady world I feel<br>
  Eternal, cold and true!"

I just had sex<br>
And it felt so good (Felt so good)<br>
A woman let me put<br>
My penis inside of her<br>
I just had sex<br>
And I'll never go back (Never go back)<br>
To the not-having-sex<br>
Ways of the past<br><br>

Have you ever had sex?<br>
I have it felt great<br>
It felt so good<br>
When I did it with my penis<br>
A girl let me do it<br>
It literally just happened<br>
Having sex can make a nice<br>
Man out of the meanest<br><br>

Never guess where I just came from<br>
I had sex<br>
If I had to describe the feeling<br>
It was the best<br>
When I had the sex<br>
Man my penis felt great<br>
And I called my parents<br>
Right after I was done<br><br>

Oh hey, didn't see you there<br>
Guess what I just did?<br>
Had sex, undressed<br>
Saw her boobies and the rest<br>
Was sure nice of her to let you<br>
Do that thing<br>
Nice of any girl ever<br>
Now sing<br><br>

I just had sex<br>
And it felt so good (Felt so good)<br>
A woman let me put<br>
My penis inside of her<br>
I wanna tell the world<br><br>

To be honest I'm surprised<br>
She even wanted me to do it<br>
Doesn't really make sense<br>
But man, screw it<br>
I ain't one to argue<br>
With a good thing<br>
She could be my wife<br>
That good?<br>
The best 30 seconds of my life (My life)<br><br>

I'm so humbled by a girls ability<br>
To let me do her<br>
Cuz honestly I'd have sex<br>
With a pile of manure<br>
With that in mind<br>
The soft, nice smelling girls better<br>
Cuz she let me wear<br>
My chain and turtle neck sweater<br><br>

So this one's dedicated to them girls<br>
That let us flop around on top of them<br>
If you're near or far<br>
Whether short or tall<br>
We wanna thank you all<br>
For letting us fuck you<br><br>

She kept looking at her watch<br>
(Doesn't matter, had sex)<br>
But I cried the whole time<br>
(Doesn't matter, had sex)<br>
I think she might've been a racist<br>
(Doesn't matter, had sex)<br>
She put a bag on my head<br>
(Still counts)<br><br>

I just had sex (Sex)<br>
And all my dreams came true (Dreams came true)<br>
So if you had sex in the last<br>
30 minutes then you're qualified<br>
To sing with me<br>

I just had sex (Everybody sing)<br>
And it felt so good (We all had sex)<br>
A woman let me put<br>
My penis inside of her (I wanna tell the world)<br>
I just had sex<br>
And I'll never go back (No no no)<br>
To the not-having-sex<br>
Ways of the past<br>

Eat at a local restaurant tonight. Get the cream sauce. Have a cold

the steak rare. Eat an oyster. Have a Negroni. Have two. Be open to a

on your friends. Check in on yourself. Enjoy the ride.

   So, uh, he tells me that she's working as a housekeeper now, right? And she's dating this dude, Carlos, 
   who's a shot caller from across the bay. And she tells him about the dude that she's cleaning for. Right? 
   That he's like this big-shot CEO, that is all retired now, but he's loaded. And so, Carlos and Ernesto are on the same softball team, 
   and they get to talking, right? And here comes the good part. Carlos says, "Yo, man. 
   This guy's got a big-<span id="blur">a</span>ss safe just sitting in the basement, just chilling." Of course Ernesto comes to me because he knows I got mad 
   thieving skills. Of course, I ask him... "Did Emily tell Carlos to tell you to get to me what kind of safe it was?" And he says, "Nah, dawg. 
   All she said is that it's super-legit and whatever's in it it's gotta be good."
